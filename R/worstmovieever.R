  print("Unstoppable with Denzel Washington. The whole premise is that a train full of bombs or something is out of control and they need to derail it before it reaches a town. No one even thinks of parking a truck or something on the tracks. Their attemps to stop it include: 1. Using another train to try and ram it (Fails and kills a guy) 2. Dropping a guy from a helicopter on the runaway train (Fails and almost kills a guy). 3. Shooting at it with handguns and rifles (Obviously fails, cmon really?!). 4. Chris Pine jumps on it from the back of a pick up and turns it off. (Succeeds! Maybe start here next time).")
